    "# Examples of Variable Expressions in AllVue\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key things to remember throughout\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the expression throws an error for *any* respondent, the whole chart will error\n",
    "* Only a subset of python is supported in AllVue, so if an expression that works here is rejected, check the [docs](https://docs.savanta.com/internal/Content/AllVue/Introduction_to_Field_Expressions.html?Highlight=expressions), and ask Aila for an equivalent expression that only uses syntax mentioned in the [docs](https://docs.savanta.com/internal/Content/AllVue/Introduction_to_Field_Expressions.html?Highlight=expressions)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Write down these three things in text form:\n",
    "1. **Input shape** - Is there one result? Or is it split down per entity?\n",
    "2. **Result shape** - Is there one result? Or is it split down per entity?\n",
    "    * In a UI world this would be the props\n",
    "    * In an Object Oriented world this would be the fields of the class\n",
    "    * In a functional world this would be the parameters\n",
    "3. **Transformation requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In Python or tabular format, write down one example of input data.\n",
    "5. Write down the expected output for this input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now build up the expression piece by piece to get there\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python objects available\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are always evaluated in the context of a single respondent, and a single result data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `response.some_variable()` returns a list of the values in the \"Value\" column of some_variable for this respondent \n",
    "  * `response.some_variable(some_entity=[7]})` returns the above list, but only returns the \"Value\" where the \"some_entity\" column matches the given value or values\n",
    "* If (and only if) you mention result.some_entity, the output data will have a column called some_entity.\n",
    "  * `result.some_entity` is always an integer id of the entity on the result row currently being considered.\n",
    "  * If you want the result to have a row for instance of some_entity, you must mention result.some_entity\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: By convention, for single-answer questions/variables, the Value is equal to the answer entity id"
