# Description of items in this folder

The Excel files in this folder describe how dates need to be renapped by respondent ID for various dashboards. This mainly affects sample from the early months of WGSN Barometer, where there was some overflow into the following month in order to make up totals for individual quota cells.

Quota is normalised on a monthly basis.

*This is not something we consider good practice for dashboarded data (in particular) and is something we aim to discourage/improve on as time goes on: for example, by normalising quotas twice a month and automating the quota targeting process.*
